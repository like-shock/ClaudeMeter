  SECURITY NOTE: com.apple.security.network.server is required for the OAuth
  callback server. The server lifetime is minimized in OAuthService:
  - Server is bound only during active login flow
  - Auto-closes immediately after receiving a valid callback
  - Request count is limited to prevent abuse
  - Consider migrating to Custom URL Scheme to remove this entitlement entirely
